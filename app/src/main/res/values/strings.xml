    <string name="onboarding1_text0a">Hey there, <b>welcome to Cogito!</b> ðŸ¥° </string>
    <string name="onboarding1_text0b">Our app is designed to help you <b>cultivate mindfulness in your everyday life</b>.</string>

    <string name="onboarding1_sect1">What is mindfulness?</string>
    <string name="onboarding1_text1"><b>Mindfulness is the state of being fully engaged in what you\'re doing</b> - whether it\'s talking to a friend, eating a meal, or just walking. When you\'re mindful, you\'re simply aware of what\'s happening in the present moment, and <b>you\'re able to observe your thoughts and emotions without getting caught up in them.</b></string>

    <string name="onboarding1_sect2">What benefits would I get?</string>
    <string name="onboarding1_text2a">Research has shown that mindfulness can help you <b>reduce stress and anxiety, increase focus and concentration, enhance sleep quality, improve relationships, and boost overall well-being</b> ðŸ¤©.</string>

    <string name="onboarding1_sect3">How can I practice it?</string>
    <string name="onboarding1_text3a">Mindfulness can be practiced through techniques such as <b>meditation, breathing exercises, and body scans.</b> The ultimate goal is to bring the same level of awareness that is cultivated during such formal practices to the rest of the day. </string>
    <string name="onboarding1_text3b">There are many ways to incorporate mindfulness into daily life, such as <b>paying attention to the sensations in the body</b> while washing dishes, or simply noticing the sounds and sights around you during a walk outside.</string>

    <string name="onboarding2_title">About the App</string>
    <string name="onboarding2_prev_btn">Previous</string>
    <string name="onboarding2_next_btn">Next</string>

    <string name="onboarding2_text0a">As opposed to traditional voice-guided meditation apps, Cogito gives you the tools to <b>practice independently</b> and <b>fully personalise your experience</b>.</string>
    <string name="onboarding2_text0b">Andâ€¦ <b>you can use it both for formal practice</b>, such as meditation and breathing exercises, <b>or during your day-to-day activities</b>. Isn\'t that awesome?! ðŸ˜† </string>

    <string name="onboarding2_sect1">How does it work?</string>
    <string name="onboarding2_text1a">With our app, you can customise your practice through configurations. <b>Think of a configuration like a recipe</b> for your mindfulness session ðŸ¥—: you can choose <b>how long you want to practice for</b> and <b>what type of music you want to listen to</b> in the background. The right music can help create a more peaceful atmosphere to deepen your experience. </string>
    <string name="onboarding2_text1b">Additionally, <b>you can set different bell sounds to play throughout your session</b> - bells serve as gentle reminders to bring your attention back to the present moment, in case your mind starts to wander.</string>
    <string name="onboarding2_text1c">Once you\'ve created your perfect recipe, <b>simply hit play andâ€¦ let your session begin!</b> ðŸ˜„</string>

    <string name="onboarding2_sect2">What do I do during a session?</string>
    <string name="onboarding2_text2">Once you start using the app, <b>click on the help button</b> in the top-right corner <b>to get specific tips</b> on how to practice mindfulness effectively! </string>

    <string name="onboarding2_sect3">Is it for me?</string>
    <string name="onboarding2_text3">Although our app is designed with experienced mindfulness practitioners in mind, <b>beginners are absolutely welcome to use it as well</b>. We believe that <b>mindfulness is a journey, and everyone has to start somewhere.</b></string>

    <string name="onboarding2_text4">We hope you find our app helpful in your mindfulness journey. <b>Happy practicing!</b> ðŸ˜Š</string>

    <string name="onboarding3_text0a">Remember that mindfulness practice is a journey, and <b>like any journey, there will be bumps in the road</b>. Don\'t get discouraged if you find yourself struggling to focus during your practice: this is a normal part of the process!</string>
    <string name="onboarding3_text0b">Importantly, <b>if at any point you feel overwhelmed</b> or anxious, please pause the session and <b>take a break</b>.</string>


    <string name="onboarding3_sect1">Is mindfulness a medical tool?</string>
    <string name="onboarding3_text1">No. <b>Mindfulness practice should not be used as a substitute for professional medical or mental health treatment</b>. If you are experiencing severe or ongoing mental health concerns, please seek the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional.</string>


    <string name="onboarding3_sect2">Can I use Cogito anytime?</string>
    <string name="onboarding3_text2">It\'s important to <b>use caution when practicing mindfulness while engaged in activities that require your full attention</b>, such as driving or operating machinery. It is recommended that you practice mindfulness in a safe, quiet environment where you can fully focus on the practice without distractions. </string>

    <string name="onboarding3_text3">Above all, remember that <b>there is no right or wrong way to do it</b>. Each moment of difficulty is an opportunity to learn something new about yourself!</string>

    <string name="tips_text0a">When you start a session in Cogito, <b>you can practice either formally or informally</b>. Formal practice involves setting aside a specific time to engage in mindfulness practice, while informal practice involves bringing mindful awareness to daily activities.</string>

    <string name="tips_sect1">What if I\'m new to mindfulness?</string>
    <string name="tips_text1a">If you are a beginner, <b>you may find it helpful to start with formal practice</b> and then eventually integrate mindfulness into your day-to-day activities as well.</string>
    <string name="tips_text1b"><b>It\'s better to start with short sessions</b>, such as 5â€“10 minutes, <b>and then gradually increase</b> the length of the practice as you feel more comfortable ðŸ˜Š.</string>


    <string name="tips_sect2">How can I do formal practice?</string>
    <string name="tips_text2a"><b>Find a quiet place</b> where you won\'t be disturbed for the duration of the session. Then, <b>choose a comfortable seated position</b>, ideally with your back straight but not tense - or, if you prefer, lie down. <b>Allow your eyes to gently close</b>.</string>
    <string name="tips_text2b">You may engage in the following techniques:</string>
    <string name="tips_text2c"><b>Breathing Exercise</b> - Start by taking a few deep breaths to relax. Next, focus your attention on your breath and notice the sensations in your body as you breathe in and out. If your mind starts to wander, notice the thought and gently redirect your attention back to your breath.</string>
    <string name="tips_text2d"><b>Body Scan</b> - Begin by slowly bringing your attention to your toes and notice any sensations in that area. Gradually move your attention up your body, observing any feelings as you go, until you reach the top of your head. If you feel any tension or discomfort, try to relax that area by taking a deep breath.</string>
    <string name="tips_text2e"><b>Loving-kindness Meditation</b> - Start by taking a few deep breaths. Then, bring to mind a person you care about and silently repeat phrases such as \"May you be happy, may you be healthy, may you be safe, may you live with ease.\" Repeat these phrases for yourself, the person you care about, and eventually for all beings.</string>

    <string name="tips_sect3">How can I do informal practice?</string>
    <string name="tips_text3a">If practicing mindfulness informally, you may use the following techniques:</string>
    <string name="tips_text3b"><b>Mindful walking</b> - Find a quiet place to walk. As you move, focus on the sensations in your feet and legs - such as the feeling of your feet touching the ground. If your mind starts to wander, simply notice the thought and gently redirect your attention back to your walking.</string>
    <string name="tips_text3c"><b>Mindful eating</b> - Choose a food that you enjoy and take a few moments to appreciate it before you begin eating. As you eat, focus on the sensations in your mouth - such as the taste, smell, and texture of your food. Notice any thoughts or emotions that arise.</string>
